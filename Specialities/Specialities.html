<h1 class="right-heading"> Minimal Access / laparoscopic Surgery</h1>
<p class="right-content">

Minimal Access/Laparoscopic Surgery is a surgical technique which involves small (keyhole) incisions instead of large cuts. The surgeon introduces a telescope with a video camera through this incision into the body cavity and operates by viewing the internal parts on a TV monitor.The video camera efficiently becomes a surgeon’s eyes in minimal access surgery, since to perform the procedure; the surgeon uses the image from the video camera placed inside the patient’s body. When the abdomen is operated using a telescope, the procedure is called laparoscopy. On the other hand, when used in a joint, it is called arthroscopy, and when used in the chest, the procedure is called thoracoscopy

<br><br>This minimal access surgery helps in early recovery of patients as they are usually walking around in a few hours after the surgery and can resume their daily activities in no time. Laparoscopic surgery causes minimal pain and has excellent cosmetic results. When compared to traditional open surgery, in laparoscopic or minimal access surgery patients experience less pain, less scarring and have a shorter recovery time. Minimal access surgery can successfully treat thyroid and parathyroid, hernia, appendix, anorectal conditions, diseases of gastrointestinal tract, gall bladder stones and certain clinical conditions involving pancreas, adrenal glands, spleen, kidneys and the liver.

<h1 class="left-heading"> Liver Transplant And Biliary Sciences</h1>
<p class="left-content">

In liver transplant surgery, the patient’s old liver is removed completely and a new one from a liver donor is put in the same place after joining the blood vessels and the bile duct. The donor liver can be from a dead person where usually the whole liver is transplanted or more commonly it is from a family member who donates part of his or her liver. Although we only have one liver in our body, liver can now be safely divided in to 2 parts so that one part can be taken out for transplantation and the remaining liver is sufficient for the donor. Both these portions can regenerate quickly to its original size though the shape will become different. Liver transplant is reserved for those whose liver disease has progressed so much that their general condition is critical. Generally, these are patients who have exhausted other forms of treatment or side by side have developed liver cancer. In cadaveric transplant, the wait can be unpredictable and some patients will die while waiting for a donor liver. On the other hand, living donor liver transplant can be done when the patient really needs it and when the entire team is available as it is a planned operation.

<h1 class="left-heading"> Bone Marrow Transplant</h1>
<p class="left-content">
A bone marrow transplant is a medical procedure performed to replace unhealthy bone marrow stem cells with the healthy ones. This transplant is carried out to treat people with conditions like leukaemia - Blood Cancer, multiple myeloma, severe blood diseases such as aplastic anaemia, thalassemia, sickle cell anaemia and certain immune deficiency diseases. Typically, the stem cells are collected via a peripheral vein. The whole bone marrow transplant procedure is like donating blood or platelets. The stem cells from the bone marrow are in charge for producing blood cells like platelets (thrombocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes) and red blood cells (erythrocytes), which later are injected in a recipient after a short course of chemotherapy.

<br><br>The bone marrow transplant procedure is performed to treat several conditions (cancerous and non-cancerous) and is extremely safe for the donor. Furthermore, the patient can go back to healthy life within 6 to 12 months post successful bone marrow transplant. Max Hospitals are designed with High-Efficiency Particulate Air filter (HEPA filter) for protective isolation so that risk of infections is minimised.</p>
